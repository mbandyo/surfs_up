# Surfs Up
This project aims to analyze weather data in Hawaii to help in decision making regarding financing of a proposed ice cream business in a surfing island spot.
Data is available and and could be downloaded on local machines. There is sufficient daily data spanning a few years for tempareture and precipitation from a number of stations spread around the area under consideration. Diverse data protects against narrow scope and provides a broader consideration.
### Business Viability Considerations
It can be reasonably assumed that ice cream consumption would depend on people venturing for surfing spots and have access to ice cream vendor. The surfing interest could depend on precipitation and on temperature. First part of the analysis consisted of rain falls. The next part of the analysis looks at the daily temperatures. 
Also, the tremperature distribution during surfing season alone does not provide the viability of ice cream shop as on going business. So the temparetures at off season (in month of December) is also looked at to be informed as to the business viability year round.
