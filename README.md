# Surfs Up
This project aims to analyze weather data in Hawaii to help in decision making regarding financing of a proposed ice cream business in a surfing island spot.
Data is available and and could be downloaded on local machines. There is sufficient daily data spanning a few years for tempareture and precipitation from a number of stations spread around the area under consideration. Diverse data protects against narrow scope and provides a broader consideration.
